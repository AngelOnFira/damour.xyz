Hello and welcome to my Minecraft server. This server will be running
vanilla Minecraft in survival mode without any plugins. The classic experience.
 
I'll do my best to ensure that this server is running 24/7.
 
## How to join
Due to this server being intended for a close community, you must be
allow-listed before getting access to the server. To join the server you must be
on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aEkzE59). Message a moderator or
post your Minecraft username in the Minecraft chat and we'll do our best to get
you in as soon as possible.
 
The server is hosted at `damour.xyz:25565`.
 
## Rules
1. Don't harm or harass other users.
2. Don't interfere with the creations of other users without their permission.
 
## Best practices
Here are some best practices to consider following to ensure a positive
experience for everyone:
- Don't build anything that looks out of place in the environment. Examples
of such things would be giant floating platforms and giant death robots.
- Keep the environment tidy. If a creeper creates an ugly hole in the ground
patch it up. Make sure you remove all the wood logs from trees when cutting
them down so that the world doesn't get littered with floating forests.
 
## Moderating
Moderators are expected to follow the following rules:
1. Mod powers should only be used to remove offending users from the server.
Under no circumstances should a moderator use their powers to perform actions
that would not be possible in survival mode such as spawning in items and
teleportation.
 
Have fun!
